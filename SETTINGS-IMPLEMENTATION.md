# Settings Page Enhancement - RBAC Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the Settings page with dynamic data loading, proper API integration, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Settings Management
- **Real-time data loading**: Settings are loaded from the backend API
- **Form state management**: Local forms sync with server state
- **Auto-save functionality**: Changes are saved to the server automatically
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during save operations

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Profile Settings**: All authenticated users can edit their profile
- **Company Settings**: Only administrators can access and modify company settings
- **Role Management**: Role changes are restricted to administrators
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges and warnings for permission restrictions

### 3. Settings Categories

#### Profile Settings
- Personal information (name, email, phone, location)
- Avatar management
- Role display (read-only for non-admins)

#### Company Settings (Admin Only)
- Company name, email, website, address
- Only visible to users with admin role
- Disabled fields for non-admin users

#### Notification Preferences

- Two-factor authentication toggle (placeholder)
- Active sessions management

#### Appearance Settings
- Theme selection (light/dark/system)
- Language preferences
- Timezone settings

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **useSettings Hook**: Centralized settings state management
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls for all settings operations
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

### Backend API Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/password` - Change password
- `GET /api/auth/preferences` - Get user preferences
- `PUT /api/auth/preferences` - Update user preferences
- `GET /api/company/settings` - Get company settings (admin only)
- `PUT /api/company/settings` - Update company settings (admin only)

### Database Schema Updates
Enhanced Profile model with:
- `phone` and `location` fields
- `preferences` object for notifications and appearance settings

### RBAC Implementation
- Middleware-level permission checks
- Frontend conditional rendering based on user role
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access

## Security Features
- Authentication required for all settings operations
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Password validation and secure hashing
- Session management and logout functionality

## User Experience
- Loading states during API calls
- Success/error toast notifications
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Intuitive tab-based navigation

## Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for settings hook
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- RBAC permission testing
- Form validation testing
- Error handling scenarios
