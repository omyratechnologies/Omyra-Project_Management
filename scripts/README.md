## üìã Script Usage Guidelines

### **Before Running Scripts:**
1. Ensure you have appropriate permissions
2. Review script configuration variables
3. Test in development environment first
4. Have backup/rollback plan ready

### **Environment Variables:**
Most scripts rely on environment variables. Ensure these are properly configured:
- `HOST` - Server hostname/IP
- `USERNAME` - SSH username
- `SSH_KEY` - SSH private key path
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string

### **Execution Permissions:**
Make scripts executable before running:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deployment/deploy.sh
chmod +x scripts/ssl/setup-ssl.sh
chmod +x scripts/testing/test-deployment.sh
```

### **Logging:**
Scripts generate logs in their respective directories. Always check logs after execution:
```bash
# View recent deployment logs
tail -f /var/log/deployment.log

# Check SSL setup logs
tail -f /var/log/ssl-setup.log
```

## üîß Script Maintenance

### **Regular Updates:**
- Update scripts when system architecture changes
- Test scripts after infrastructure modifications
- Keep documentation synchronized with script changes
- Version control all script modifications

### **Security Considerations:**
- Regularly review scripts for security vulnerabilities
- Update credentials and secrets periodically
- Audit script permissions and access controls
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### **Testing:**
- Test scripts in staging environment before production
- Validate error handling and rollback procedures
- Document expected outputs and failure scenarios
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Production Safety:** Always test scripts in development/staging first
2. **Backups:** Ensure proper backups before running deployment scripts
3. **Monitoring:** Monitor system during and after script execution
4. **Documentation:** Keep execution logs and document any issues
5. **Access Control:** Restrict script access to authorized personnel only
