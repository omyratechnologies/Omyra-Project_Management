# Date Utilities Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing `RangeError: Invalid time value` errors when trying to format dates using `formatDistanceToNow` from `date-fns`. This was happening because:

1. Notification timestamps could be null, undefined, or invalid date strings
2. Direct use of `new Date(timestamp)` with invalid input was causing the error
3. The error was particularly noticeable in the `ClientNotificationCenter` component

## Solution
Created a robust set of utility functions in `/src/utils/dateUtils.ts` that safely handle date formatting:

### Functions Added:

1. **`safeFormatDistanceToNow(timestamp, options)`**
   - Safely formats timestamps to relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
   - Returns "Unknown time" for invalid inputs
   - Handles string, Date, null, and undefined inputs

2. **`safeFormatDate(timestamp, formatString)`**
   - Safely formats timestamps to specific date formats
   - Returns "Unknown date" for invalid inputs
   - Supports custom format strings

3. **`isValidTimestamp(timestamp)`**
   - Validates if a timestamp is valid
   - Returns boolean indicating validity

### Files Updated:
- `/src/components/client/ClientNotificationCenter.tsx`
- `/src/components/dashboard/NotificationCenter.tsx`
- `/src/components/client/ClientRecentActivity.tsx`
- `/src/components/client/ClientProjectOverview.tsx`
- `/src/components/client/ClientFeedbackCenter.tsx`
- `/src/components/project/ProjectDetails.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`

### Key Changes:
1. Added validation for notification data in the `useNotifications` hook
2. Replaced direct `formatDistanceToNow(new Date(timestamp))` calls with `safeFormatDistanceToNow(timestamp)`
3. Added null/undefined checks for notification properties
4. Added error logging for debugging invalid timestamps

## Testing
The fix has been tested by:
1. Building the application successfully
2. Adding defensive programming for edge cases
3. Ensuring backward compatibility with existing data

This fix prevents the application from crashing when invalid date data is received and provides helpful fallback messages for users.
