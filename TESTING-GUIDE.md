```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@omyra.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Get Profile (requires token)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/auth/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Projects
```bash
# Get all projects
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Create project
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Project", "description": "Testing", "status": "planning"}'
```

### Tasks
```bash
# Get all tasks
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Update task status
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "in_progress"}'
```

## üö® Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Real-time Updates**: Currently no WebSocket implementation for live updates
2. **File Uploads**: Avatar uploads not yet implemented
3. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented in current version
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Some advanced filter options may need refinement

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The system is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ All users can login/logout successfully
2. ‚úÖ Dashboard displays data from backend
3. ‚úÖ Projects CRUD operations work for authorized users
4. ‚úÖ Tasks CRUD operations work for authorized users
5. ‚úÖ RBAC restricts access appropriately
6. ‚úÖ All API endpoints return expected data
7. ‚úÖ Frontend handles errors gracefully
8. ‚úÖ Navigation works across all pages
9. ‚úÖ Responsive design works on different screen sizes
10. ‚úÖ No console errors in browser dev tools

## üéâ What's Been Accomplished

- ‚úÖ Complete removal of Supabase dependencies
- ‚úÖ New Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend
- ‚úÖ Full authentication system with JWT
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚úÖ RESTful API with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Frontend integration with Axios
- ‚úÖ Database seeding with realistic test data
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ All core features working end-to-end

The Omyra Project Management System is now fully operational with the new backend!
